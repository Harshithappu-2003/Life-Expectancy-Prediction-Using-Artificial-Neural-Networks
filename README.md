### ‚ùì Problem Statement

Life expectancy is a key indicator of a country‚Äôs healthcare quality and overall well-being. Accurately predicting it based on health, demographic, and economic features can help governments and organizations make data-driven policy decisions. The problem addressed in this project is how to use historical and statistical data to effectively predict the life expectancy of a country.

### üîç Approach / Methodology

*   **Model Type**: Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    
*   **Architecture**: A simple feedforward neural network built using TensorFlow/Keras.
    
    *   Input Layer: Based on the number of features
        
    *   Hidden Layers: Dense layers with ReLU activation
        
    *   Output Layer: Single neuron for regression
        
*   **Data Handling**:
    
    *   Cleaned missing values
        
    *   Encoded categorical variables
        
    *   Normalized feature data
        
*   **Training**: Model was trained using `mean_squared_error` as the loss function and the `adam` optimizer.
    
*   **Validation**: Used a train-test split (80-20) to evaluate the model performance.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Future Work

*   **Limitations**:
    
    *   Data contains missing values that were imputed
        
    *   Assumes a static model‚Äîdoesn't account for time-series trends
        
    *   Simpler ANN architecture might not capture all complex patterns
        
*   **Future Improvements**:
    
    *   Use advanced models like RNNs or LSTMs for temporal data analysis
        
    *   Add more recent or dynamic datasets (e.g., post-COVID stats)
        
    *   Hyperparameter tuning and model ensembling
        
    *   Deploy as a web-based tool using Flask/Streamlit
